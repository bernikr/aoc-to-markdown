# Advent of Code to Markdown Userscript

Converts a given [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) page to GitHub-compatible Markdown and copies it to the clipborad.
This userscript is adapted from the [this browser addon](https://github.com/kfarnung/aoc-to-markdown).

## Why

I dont like having to install addons for small functionality. Also I need to paste the markdown into a chat, so having to save it first is annoying.

## Install

Install a User Script Manager of your choice and [click this link to install](https://github.com/bernikr/aoc-to-markdown/raw/main/aoc-to-markdown.user.js).
